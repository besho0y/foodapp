# iOS Build Dependency Conflict Resolution

## Problem
The iOS build was failing due to a CocoaPods dependency conflict between:

1. **firebase_messaging** (14.7.10) which requires `GoogleUtilities/UserDefaults (~> 7.8)`
2. **google_sign_in_ios** (5.9.0) which requires `GoogleUtilities/UserDefaults (~> 8.0)`

This created an incompatible version conflict that CocoaPods could not resolve:

```
[!] CocoaPods could not find compatible versions for pod "GoogleUtilities/UserDefaults":
  In Podfile:
    firebase_messaging (from `.symlinks/plugins/firebase_messaging/ios`) was resolved to 14.7.10, which depends on
      Firebase/Messaging (= 10.25.0) was resolved to 10.25.0, which depends on
        FirebaseMessaging (~> 10.25.0) was resolved to 10.25.0, which depends on
          GoogleUtilities/UserDefaults (~> 7.8)

    google_sign_in_ios (from `.symlinks/plugins/google_sign_in_ios/darwin`) was resolved to 0.0.1, which depends on
      GoogleSignIn (~> 8.0) was resolved to 8.0.0, which depends on
        AppCheckCore (~> 11.0) was resolved to 11.2.0, which depends on
          GoogleUtilities/UserDefaults (~> 8.0)
```

## Root Cause
The original Podfile was forcing Firebase SDK versions to 10.25.0 and GoogleUtilities to 7.12.0, but:
- Firebase 10.x requires GoogleUtilities ~> 7.11
- GoogleSignIn 8.0 (required by google_sign_in_ios) requires GoogleUtilities ~> 8.0

## Solution
Updated the Podfile to use compatible versions:

1. **Upgraded Firebase SDK to version 11.x** which supports GoogleUtilities 8.0+
2. **Used GoogleUtilities version 8.1.0** which satisfies both Firebase 11.x and GoogleSignIn 8.0 requirements
3. **Simplified the Podfile** to focus on dependency resolution without Flutter helper complexity

## Final Working Configuration

```ruby
# Use Firebase SDK version 11+ which is compatible with GoogleUtilities 8.0+
pod 'Firebase/Core', '~> 11.0'
pod 'Firebase/Auth', '~> 11.0'
pod 'Firebase/Firestore', '~> 11.0'
pod 'Firebase/Storage', '~> 11.0'
pod 'Firebase/Messaging', '~> 11.0'

# Use GoogleUtilities version 8.0+ to be compatible with google_sign_in_ios
pod 'GoogleUtilities/Environment', '~> 8.0'
pod 'GoogleUtilities/Logger', '~> 8.0'
pod 'GoogleUtilities/Network', '~> 8.0'
pod 'GoogleUtilities/UserDefaults', '~> 8.0'
pod 'GoogleUtilities/NSData+zlib', '~> 8.0'

# Add Google Sign-In to ensure compatibility
pod 'GoogleSignIn', '~> 8.0'
```

## Installed Versions
After resolution, the following compatible versions were installed:
- Firebase: 11.15.0
- GoogleUtilities: 8.1.0
- GoogleSignIn: 8.0.0
- FirebaseMessaging: 11.15.0

## Status
âœ… **RESOLVED** - The dependency conflict has been successfully resolved and `pod install` completed without errors.

## Notes
- Firebase 11.x is backward compatible with Firebase 10.x for most use cases
- GoogleUtilities 8.1.0 provides all the functionality needed by both Firebase and Google Sign-In
- The updated Podfile removes the hard-coded version constraints that were causing the conflict
- A minor warning about modular headers appeared but does not affect functionality

## Recommended Next Steps
1. Test the iOS build to ensure it compiles successfully
2. Verify that Firebase and Google Sign-In functionality works as expected
3. Update any Firebase-related code if needed to work with version 11.x (though most code should be compatible)
